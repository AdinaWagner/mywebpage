I'm a Masters student in Clinical Neuroscience, currently writing my thesis. Throughout my studies, I have peeked into various fields within Psychology - Differential Psychology, Forensic Psychology, Comparative Psychology, Neuropsychology - and worked in each for substantial amount of time or projects. Finally, I found my call in Psychoinformatics, at the intersection of Neuroscience, Computer Science, Statistics and Psychology. Thanks to Michael Hanke, my current Masters thesis and future Ph.D. supervisor, I'm now on my way to slowly become a psychoinformatician.
