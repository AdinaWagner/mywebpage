I'm a Masters student in Clinical Neuroscience, currently writing my thesis. Throughout my studies, I have peeked into various fields within Psychology - Differential Psychology, Forensic Psychology, Comparative Psychology, Neuropsychology - and worked in each for substantial amount of time or projects. In my first year, I had the amazing opportunity to work with [Florian Lange](https://feb.kuleuven.be/BEE/research-team/florian-lange/) and discover the irreproducability of ego depletion effects and participate in high quality replications even prior to the emergence of the reproducibility crisis in 2015. For three years, I was involved in the forensic assessment of victims  of sexual assault with [Prof. Daniela Hosser](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/psychologie/abt/epf/mitarbeiter/hosser), one of the most inspiring female role models for me. I was able to aqcuire teaching experience in the [KinderUni 2013](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/presse/veranstaltungen/kinderuni/archiv/2013) of the TU Braunschweig, as a lecturer for JGW.ev in the [Schuelerakademie Papenburg 2017](https://jgw-ev.de/schuelerakademie/archiv/schulerakademie-papenburg-i-2017/), and as a statistics tutor for first year B.Sc. Psychology students at the OvGU Magdeburg.
In the last year of my Bachelors studies, I had the extremely valuable possibility to work with [Dr. Ljerka Ostojic](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ljerka_Ostojic), the toughest women and most capable, integer scientistic I have met so far, in the [comparative cognition lab](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/research/ccl) in Cambridge on pseudo-episodic memory and social cognition of corvids, and also experience that none of the academic frustrations would yet be able to discourage me from pursueing a career in science.
From 2016 - 2018, in parallel to my Masters studies, I was a research associate at the [Forschungsgemeinschaft fuer kognitive Neurologie e.V.](https://www.klinikum-braunschweig.de/284.0.html) at the Clinic of Neurology in Braunschweig, conducting my first independent research project concerned with improving the detection of dementia, especially of the Alzheimer type.
Finally, after all these valuable detours, I found my call in Psychoinformatics, at the intersection of Neuroscience, Computer Science, Statistics and Psychology. Thanks to [Michael Hanke](https://github.com/mih), my current Masters thesis and future Ph.D. supervisor, the other amazing [psychoinformatics lab members](http://www.psychoinformatics.de/lab-members.html), [Yaroslav Halchenko](https://github.com/yarikoptic) and the [Haxby Lab](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/index.html), I'm now on my way to slowly become a psychoinformatician.
