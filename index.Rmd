### Hi!

<img style="float: right;" src="img/me.jpg" width="400" height="500">

I'm as surprised as you are. Welcome to this homepage. My name is Adina.
I am a Masters Student in the [Psychoinformatics Lab](http://www.psychoinformatics.de) of the Otto-von-Guericke University in the beautiful city Magdeburg. Because the city is so beautiful, I chose to live approx. 100km away and only dare to enter it during daytimes. Just kidding. I only live 100km away because I like trains a lot.

So all fun aside, you ended up on a mock/test homepage on which I will just try myself out. I don't think you'll find anything interesting here. Maybe some lame jokes that you will find weird if you don't know me in person. 

My aims with this homepage:

* Trying out this [awesome tutorial](https://gupsych.github.io/acadweb/content.html) that [Oliver](https://olivercontier.com/) retweeted a while ago
* Have a website ready for when I will write an informative blogpost on something
* procrastenate from writing my thesis



Where you can find me:
