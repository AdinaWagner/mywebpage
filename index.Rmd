I am a Masters Student in the Psychoinformatics Lab (http://www.psychoinformatics.de) of the Otto-von-Guericke University in the beautiful city Magdeburg. Because the city is so beautiful, I chose to live approx. 100km away and only dare to enter it during daytimes. Just kidding. I only live 100km away because I like trains a lot.
